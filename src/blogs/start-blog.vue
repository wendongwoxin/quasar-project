  <h2>Just Do it!</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      Around June last year, I suddenly had an idea to write a personal blog!
      Unfortunately, I have only started to do this now, and I have started to
      give up countless times in between.During this time I tried to write my
      own personal blog in many different ways, like hexo,vuepress,etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've made countless excuses to tell myself to stop writing, it's just a
      waste of time. for Example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>no one reads it</li>
      <li>don't know what to write</li>
      <li>which way to build</li>
      <li>Where to publish and how to maintain</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But even with so many excuses, I still think how cool it would be to have
      my own independent blog! Don't hesitate, just do it!

  <h2>How to do it</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      My blog is written by
      <a href="https://quasar.dev/" style="color: blueviolet" target="_blank"
        >quasar</a
      >, an open-source Vue.js based framework. Why i chosen this ? i don't
      know! Maybe when I was about to write a blog, I was just learning this
      framework, and there was no project to practice, so I used my blog to
      practice. If you want to know more, you can refer to
      
      <a
        href="https://github.com/wendongwoxin/quasar-project"
        style="color: blueviolet"
        target="_blank"
        >my code</a
      >;
    </p>
    <p style="color: red">
      Warning: It is not recommended to build a blog in this way, because it is difficult to maintain !
    </p>
    <p>
      So when you learn a framework later, you don't know what projects to
      practice, and it happens that you don't have your own blog, so go to write
      a blog, so that you will have a deeper understanding of this framework,
      which is also a a good way to learn.

  <h2>what to write</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      This is my own blog, I can write anything I want. However, as you can see,
      I blog to learn and share, so more content may be some technology related
      content and my own understanding of technology.
