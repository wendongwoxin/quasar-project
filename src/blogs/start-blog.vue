  <h2>Just Do it!</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
      Around June last year, I suddenly had an idea to write a personal blog!
      Unfortunately, I have only started to do this now, and I have started to
      give up countless times in between.During this time I tried to write my
      own personal blog in many different ways, like hexo,vuepress,etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've made countless excuses to tell myself to stop writing, it's just a
      waste of time. for Example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>no one reads it</li>
      <li>don't know what to write</li>
      <li>which way to build</li>
      <li>Where to publish and how to maintain</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But even with so many excuses, I still think how cool it would be to have
      my own independent blog!
